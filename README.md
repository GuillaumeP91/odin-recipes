# odin-recipes

During this project, I have learnt to put into practice several concepts used such as setting up the basics HTML page, anchoring links and images with absolue and relative links, using ordered and unordered list, playing around different titles sizes, cleaning my coding and final but not least, adding to staging, committing and pushing to GITHUB. 

I am now much faster in my coding and remember more most of the controls used or know where to find the info.
